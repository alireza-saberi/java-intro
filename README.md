# Java introduction
CEJV 416 - Winter 2018. Good for reviewing and, practicing basic of JAVA programming

***This course is the gateway to the Java and Web Programming programs.***

### Course Description
This course introduces students to OOP (Object Oriented Programming) using Java. The student will first learn
fundamental programming structures including data types, operators, branching and looping structures, userdefined
methods, and basic data structures. The student will develop classes that use OOP features such as
encapsulation, inheritance, interfaces, overloading, overriding and polymorphism. Skills in basic GUI (Graphical
User Interface) programming and database access using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) will be acquired. Upon
completion of this course, the student will be able to design, code, and test functional OOP applications. This
course is suitable for students without any programming background.

### Course Objectives

Model data with primitive and user-defined data types
- Utilize loops for receptive processing
- Make decisions using control structures
- Use the Java language to implement algorithms to solve problems
- Apply object oriented methodology to program design
- Write programs that use basic GUI components
- Access data in relational databases using JDBC
